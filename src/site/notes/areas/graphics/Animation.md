* Animation is mostly an extension of modelling where we try to represent a model as a sequence of images which when viewed sequentially gives us a sense of motion.
* Film requires 24 fps and VR requires 90 fps.
* *Artist driven animation:* rigging, skinning and posing
* *Data driven animation:* motion capture
* *Procedural animation:* describing the motion algorithmically and describing the motion using a small number of parameters
* Fundamental concepts in animation:
	* Squash and Stretch
	* Timing
	* Key Framing (Specify only certain frames and then generate the ones in between, this generation is called tweening)

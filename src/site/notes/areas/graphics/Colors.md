* Colour for the observer = Illuminance x Reflectance.
* 3 Primary colours: Red, Green and Blue.
* Our eyes have 3 cones: L, M and S.
* Coloured light are additive because they "sum up their wavelengths"  when overlapping with each other
* Chemical pigments and ink are subtractive colours

---
* **Intensity:** Absolute brightness, unit candela per square metre. AUC of Energy x Wavelength. More AUC => More Amount of that wavelength
* **Hue:** Predominant wavelength that defines the colour. Mean of the graph (Energy x wavelength).
* **Saturation/Chroma:** Amount of achromatic light = Variance from the mean. (how close it is to white)

## Colour Space
* Standard Colour Space: CIE XYZ
	* The 3 values for each wavelength (RGB) are known as tri-stimulus values.
* Some values in the Red wavelength can't be perceived (negative wavelength) so we simply modify them by adding respective green and blue counterparts.

## Chromaticity Chart
* 2D projection of 3D colours $$x = X / (Z+ Y+ Z), y = Y /(X+Y+Z)$$
* The realisable chromaticity is always a triangle in the XY chromaticity chromaticity diagram because we can only add lights together and there are no negative lights.

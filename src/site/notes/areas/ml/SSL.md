#self-supervised-learning
Typically methods make assumptions about the underlying data for a better decision function. These include:
* **Smoothness Assumption:** samples close together in feature space are likely to be from the same class
* **Cluster Assumption:** samples in a cluster are likely to be from the same class
* **Low Density Assumption:** class boundaries are likely to be in areas of the feature space that have lower density than the cluster
